# Mohamed Aashif Ahmed Bishry - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explanation

This is the repository for my Web Development II Portfolio Project. I began by using my UX Hi Fidelity wireframe as a starting point for my overall design, I used bootstrap to build the overall layout of the site, and also experimented with some javascript to build some interesting animations. The pages include my project lists in the home page, along with an about page with a brief introduction and vision. THis is coupled with a contact page as well. During this project I learned plenty of new things including bootstrap and libraries and faced challenges referencing bootstrap layouts and some javascript work.

### Challenges

- Using javascript to build the intro for the site
- Bootstrap layout to figure out efficient responsiveness
- Building Infinite Marquee using only CSS
- Using animation libraries.


### Lessons Learned

- Using bootstrap efficiently 
- Using Libraries
